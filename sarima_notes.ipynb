Really, this this three racoons models standing on eachother's shoulders in a trench coat. It will be helpful to consider each little racoon as its own entity before looking at the whole coated figure.\n",

How many days back is most helpful for allowing us to predict tomorrow's sales? Only yesterday? Only 3 days ago? In essence, we're drawing a best fit line through a scatter plot of lagged data (the x values) and the current data (y values) to see which one has the least amount of error.\n",

    "p is the order of your autoregressive model. It is to how many lags back the model is to observe previous values of the target variable. If you're lookin to wrangle your p paramter pardner, you will be looking at the AR piece of the SARIMA model. Forget the other stuff for now, it's AR time. It'll start making sense when you take a look at the equation for an autoregresesive model \n",
